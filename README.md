## Project Overview

In this project, you will apply the skills you have acquired in this course to operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API.

You are given a pre-trained, `sklearn` model that has been trained to predict housing prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, and so on. You can read more about the data, which was initially taken from Kaggle, on [the data source site](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing). This project tests your ability to operationalize a Python flask app—in a provided file, `app.py`—that serves out predictions (inference) about housing prices through API calls. This project could be extended to any pre-trained machine learning model, such as those for image recognition and data labeling.

### Project Tasks

Your project goal is to operationalize this working, machine learning microservice using [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), which is an open-source system for automating the management of containerized applications. In this project you will:

- Test your project code using linting
- Complete a Dockerfile to containerize this application
- Deploy your containerized application using Docker and make a prediction
- Improve the log statements in the source code for this application
- Configure Kubernetes and create a Kubernetes cluster
- Deploy a container using Kubernetes and make a prediction
- Upload a complete Github repo with CircleCI to indicate that your code has been tested

You can find a detailed [project rubric, here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2576/view).

**The final implementation of the project will showcase your abilities to operationalize production microservices.**

## Setup the Environment

- Create a virtualenv and activate it
- Run `make install` to install the necessary dependencies

### Running `app.py`

1. Standalone: `python app.py`
2. Run in Docker: `./run_docker.sh`
3. Run in Kubernetes: `./run_kubernetes.sh`

### Kubernetes Steps

- Setup and Configure Docker locally
- Setup and Configure Kubernetes locally
- Create Flask app in Container
- Run via kubectl

### Files

- run_kubernetes.sh: This script runs the docker image in a kubernetes cluster
- upload_docker.sh: This script uploads a docker image to docker hub
- make_prediction.sh: This script sends data for prediction using curl and prints the predicted value on the command line
- run_docker.sh: This script creates a docker image from the Dockerfile, list the images and starts a container
- Dockerfile: This file has the setup for creating a Docker image for the microservice
- Makefile: This file has make commands that allows for easy setup of a project
- app.py: This is the flask app that runs the service
